# Connect The Dots

Hey! So I wanted to make a simple visual representation of the relationship between columns in a dataset. I couldn't find anything around the internet so I made this app. It simply renders
dots and connects them (if you want).

## Dot Props

- Color (Hex Code)
- Size (Number)
- Column (String) -> The column this dot represents in the dataset.
- Question (String) -> The survey question this column Answers

## Pop Up

When a dot is hovered over, a pop up is shown containing the column and survey question this dot represents.

## Future

Would like to make this a lot more customizable
